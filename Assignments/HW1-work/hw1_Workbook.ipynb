    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

The mean squared test error can be decomposed into two sources of error, described as the reducible error and the irreducible error, stemming from the noise intrinsic to our data.

Minimizing these two sources of error will minimize the reducible error in our problem.**\n",

    "> The variance is an error that comes from how sensitive the model is to small fluctuations or changes in the training data. A high variance means the algorithm is likely overfitting on the training data and modeling the noise. This will hinder the model when it comes to generalizing to new data. A more simple model will have lower variance. \n",

    "> In Machine Learning, the best models will neither overfit (high variance, low bias) nor underfit (low variance, high bias). They will strike a balance finding the model of appropriate complexity that minimizes both variance and bias in the model. This can be difficult since the data scientist does not directly observe the bias and variance of their models, and these two sources of error are generally in competition. There are bootstrapping techniques to decompose error into bias and variance, but not the irreducible error. \n",

    "# Question 3: Tokenizing\n",
    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

    "* __a) short response:__ In the Naive Bayes algorithm (which we'll implement next week), we'll estimate the _likelihood_ of a word by counting the number of times it appears and dividing by the size of the vocabulary (total number of unique words). Using the text: *\"Alice had an adventure that took alice to wonderland\"*, give a concrete example of how two different tokenizers could cause us to get two different results on this calculation. [`HINT`: _you should not need to read up on Naive Bayes to answer this question_]  \n",

Suppose __`tokenize(x)`__ is a Python function that performs the desired tokenization. What would __`tokenize(\"By-the-bye, what became of Alice's 12 hats?!\")`__ output? Type the answer in the space provided below.\n",

Let's say tokenizer 1 treats lowercase and uppercase as the same; then 'alice' would be counted twice. If tokenizer 2 treats lowercase and uppercase differently; then 'alice' would be counted once and 'Alice' would also be counted once seperately. These yield two different word frequencies. As a result, the likelihood of 'alice' would be different in these two implementations.\n",

In our wordcount results below, a grep for 'hatter' yielded 2 lines, 'hatter' and 'hatters', along with their counts. We would simply need to add their counts together in post-processing.

    "What would happen if we tried to run our script on a much larger dataset? For one thing, it would take longer to run. However there is a second concern. The Python object that aggregates our counts (`defaultdict`) exists in memory on the machine running this notebook. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. The solution? Divide and Conquer! Instead of running the script on the whole dataset at once, we could split our text up in to smaller 'chunks' and process them independently of each other. __In this question you'll use a bash script to \"parallelize\" your Word Count.__\n",

Read through this code and make sure you understand each line before you proceed. [`HINT:` _For now, ignore the 'student code' section -- you'll use that in part c._]\n",

We'll redirect the results into a file called `alice_pCounts.txt.` Run this analysis and compare the count for the word 'alice' to your answer from Question 4. Explain what went wrong and describe what we have to add to `pWordCount_v1.sh` to fix the problem.\n",

Read through this script to be sure you understand how it is written. Then follow the instructions in `pWordCount_v1.sh` to make a one-line modification so that it accepts `aggregateCounts_v1.py` as a 4th argument and uses this script to combine the chunk-ed word counts.

    "> __b)__ With no reducer specified, we are only doing the mapping operation using the `wordCount.py` python script. As a result, the 4 parallel processes independently count up the instances of 'alice' that they encounter from their line chunks. The total count of 'alice' from earlier, 403, is broken up among these 4 processes and their results. $113 + 126 + 122 + 42 = 403$. To fix this, we need to add a reducer that can aggregate, by summing, these counts of 'alice' into one total count of 403."

    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simiulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What is the potential scalability problem with the provided implementation of `aggregateCounts_v1.py`? Explain why this supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count wouldn't work on a really large input corpus.  [`HINT:` _see the intro to Q6_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code:__ Fortunately, a 'strategic sort' can solve this problem. Read the instructions at the top of `pWordCount_v2.sh` carefully then make your changes that alphabetically sort the output from the mappers (`countfiles`) before piping them into the reducer script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ This supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count wouldn't work on a really large input corpus because the reducer keeps track of word counts using a dictionary for the entire corpus. The Python object that aggregates our counts (defaultdict) exists in memory. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. This is a very memory constrained implementation, that will have trouble scaling to a larger dataset, i.e. a larger corpus and dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b-c)__ _complete the coding portions of this question before answering d and e._\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Let's assume that we have the outputs of the mappings and sorted them alphabetically such that we have one big list of 'word \\t count' that is too large to fit on a single computer. We want to split these sorted word counts in half and send these halves to the reducers. The problem is where the split occurs might be in between the word counts for the same word; let's say the split happens halfway through after a line \"the \\t 150\" and before a line \"the \\t 90\". This results in the same word having counts sent to both reducer 1 and reducer 2. This would lead to the 2 output files post-reducing to both contain word counts for \"the\". We wanted the word count of \"the\" to be aggregated in one place. We need each key to be sent to just 1 reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ When we split halfway through the data to send to our 2 reducers, we can check if the line before and after the split location have the same key (ex. \"the\"). If yes, split further down until the key on the lines before and after the split are not the same. This adjusts the split such that each key goes to only one reducer after partitioning. Then we can reduce these partitions separately."

    "### Q8 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ The two features of an ideal algorithm from a scalability perspective are: \"First, in terms of data: given twice the amount of data, the same algorithm should take at most twice as long to run, all else being equal. Second, in terms of resources: given a cluster twice the size, the same algorithm should take no more than half as long to run.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Basically the two criteria are that 1) 2x as much data will take at most 2x as long to run, 2) 2x the the number of cores or resources in your cluster should atleast halve your time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The time it takes to run the algorithm very roughly halves when going from 1 --> 2 partitions and then going from 2 --> 4 partitions. As we double the number of cores we use, or partitions we process in parallel, the algorithm run time roughly halves. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> We are running the same sized data in all 3 tests so we can only see how our observations meet Lin and Dyer's 2nd criteria that doubling the number of resources per cluster will cause the algorithm to take no more than half as long to run. This criteria is not exactly met, but is roughly observed, since the run time is not exactly halved each time we double our partitions. From 1 --> 2 partitions, it takes 57% as long. From 2 --> 4, it takes 63% as long. There is some extra overhead that comes with sorting the partitioned data, and for this relatively small dataset this adds noticeably to the run time, which would theoretically be halved by doubling the cores. If we were running the algorithm on a larger dataset, the doubling of cores would result in the run time being closer to being halved.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The run times decrease from 1 --> 2, they do not decrease from 2 --> 4 (staying around the same time as 1 core), and increase from 4 --> 8. I expected the run time to increase going 4 partitions to 8 partitions, since my computer set up only has 4 cores so the overhead of making more than 4 paritions and shuffling around will cost some runtime. Optimally, my machine would run 4 paritions with its 4 cores. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> I expected going from 2 --> 4 partitions to decrease the run time, but it did not here. My theory is that for large datasets, it should theoretically decrease the run time. However, there is some overhead with the implementation, namely sorting the intermediate outputs of the partitions and mappings. The overhead of doing 4 sorting operations vs. 2 sorting operations adds some run time complexity, which leads to the increased time on small datasets where partitioning does not offer much benefit. If this dataset was larger, we would  see more decrease in runtime as we add paritions and use more cores (up to the limit of the computer). This means that our implementation will scale well with large datasets, but does not offer much benefit when working with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Adding more partitions adds to the number of mapper processes run, and sorts done on the output of these mappings before going to the reducer. Increasing the number of partitions causes the amount of data sent to each mapper to decrease, therefore decreasing the total amount of time spent during each of these mappings. The tradeoff this costs is the number of sorting operations increasing, since we have additional mapper outputs to now sort."

    "> __a)__ In the context of word counting, an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" word counting workload describes the little to no effort needed to separate the problem of counting word frequencies into a number of parallel tasks. In this parallel word counting implementation, the documents of interest have their lines chunked up and sent to parallel tasks that will count word frequencies, with no dependency or need for communication between these parallel tasks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In our implementation in this notebook, we counted words in parallel through 4 mapper processes running on chunks of lines from Alice in Wonderland, and aggregated the results into one output document. These parallel word counting tasks did not require any communication between each other or any effort to pre or post-process the results of the counts (aside from sorting the outputs indiscriminately to improve the memory efficiency of the reducer). This was an embarrassingly parallel implementation of the word counting problem.\n",
