    "In the first three homeworks you became familiar with the Map-Reduce programming paradigm as manifested in the Hadoop Streaming and Spark frameworks. We explored how different data structures and design patterns can help us manage the computational complexity of an algorithm. As part of this process you implemented both a supervised learning alogorithm (Naive Bayes) and an unsupervised learning algorithm (synonym detection via cosine similarity). In both of these tasks parallelization helped us manage calculations involving a large number of features. However a large feature space isn't the only situation that might prompt us to want to parallelize a machine learning algorithm. In the final two assignments we'll look at cases where the iterative nature of an algorithm is the main driver of its computational complexity (and the reason we might want to parallelize it).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's assignment we'll perform 3 kinds of linear regression: OLS, Ridge and Lasso. As in previous assignments you will implement the core calculations using Spark RDDs... though we've provided more of a code base than before since the focus of the latter half of the course is more on general machine learning concepts. By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",

    "> __a)__ For a function to be convex, the 1st order condition is that the function's derivative must be equal to 0. The 2nd order condition is that the function's 2nd derivative must be positive, meaning the function is increasing everywhere. An input to the function that satisfies both of these conditions indicated a minimum of the function at that input value. We care about this for gradient descent because we know that as we follow the gradient, we are approaching an absolute minimum for the loss function (if it is a convex function). \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The problem domain space is the space where we can plot the predictors and the target of the problem we are solving. The model parameter space is the space where we can plot the model's parameters we seek and the loss function value we want to minimize. We can't find the optimal model by looking at the error surface in the model parameter space because we do not have access to the parameter space or the error surface; it is not possible to generate all these points to form the surface. That's why we use gradient descent to find the minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The learning rate captures how much we change our parameters on each gradient descent step. A larger learning rate means we should converge to an optimal solution faster, but too high of a learning rate means we could never converge because we might overshoot the optimal solution each time we update our parameters with such a large step. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ In OLS, the closed form solution is a derived analytical solution for the line that minimizes the mean squared error on the data. This can be thought of as the exact, correct solution for line of best fit. We cannot scale this closed form solution because it involves computing the inverse of a matrix, which is difficult to do in parallel. The matrix will grow larger with larger datasets, so the closed form solution does not help us solve the problem since we will not be able to compute the matrix inverse."

    "# Question 2: EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistician's approach to Linear Regression typically involves a series of EDA steps to examine each feature in the data and then a series of steps to test assumptions about their potential contribution to a multi-feature linear model. In particular, we'd want to look for a set of features that exhibit a likely linear relationship with the outcome variable and that are _not_ highy correlated with each other. In the context of machine learning, these considerations remain important techniques for improving model generalizability despite the common practice to use model evaluation techniques (and large data sets) to get the final word on feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll briefly look at the features in our data set. To mimic an 'at scale' analysis we'll start by sampling from our Spark RDD training set so that we have a manageable amount of data to work with in our visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ Run the provided code to sample 1000 points and visualize histograms of each feature. Comment on the distributions you observe (eg. _Which features appear normaly distributed, which don't? Which features vary most/least?_) How is the varaible `color` different than the other features & what does that mean about how we interpret its regression coefficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ Run the provided code to create boxplots of each feature. Which, if any, appear to have a positive linear relationship with `quality`? Which if any appear to have a negative linear relationship with `quality`?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Run the provided code to plot the correlations matrix. Which pairs of features are most _strongly_ (postively or negatively) associated with each other? What implications would that have for our feature selection?"

    "### Q2 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ We observe several distributions for our features. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> - Normally distributed features: citric acid (varies a lot), density (varies moderately), pH (varies a lot), alcohol (varies a lot). \n",
    "> - Right tail skewed: fixed acidity (besides the tail, varies moderately), volatile acidity (varies a lot), residual sugar (concentrated around 0, does not vary much), sulphates (varies moderately), \n",
    "> - Weird distributions: chlorides (spiked and concentrated around a low value, does not vary much), free sulfrur dioxide (concentrated around lower values, varies moderately), total sulfur dioxide  (varies a lot, almost forming a bimodal distribution with lower values).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Color: color appears to be a binary feature because it only takes on values of 0 or 1, unlike the other continuous variables. This means we interpret its regression coefficient as the added effect of the wine having color (`color = 1`) vs. it not having color. \n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Reading the boxplots, we would observe a positive linear relationship with quality if the boxes going further up (higher quality) are concentrated further right (higher feature value); the boxes are ascending diagonally towards top right. A negative linear relationship with quality is observed if the boxes going further up (higher quality) are concentrated further left (lower feature value); the boxes are descending diagonally towards bottom right.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Positive linear relationship with `quality`: citric acid (approximately), free sulfur dioxide (approximately), total sulfur dioxide, pH ( slightly).\n",
    "> - Negative linear relationship with `quality`: fixed acidity (slightly), volatile acidity (slightly), chlorides (slightly), density.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Reading the correlation matrix heatmap, the strongest positive correlations are the deepest red in color while the strongest negative correlations are the deepest blue in color. \n",
    "> - The feature pairs with the strongest positive correlation are: `volatile acidity & color`, `total sulfur dioxide & free sulfur dioxide`, `density & residual sugar`. \n",
    "> - The feature pairs with the strongest negative correlation are: `total sulfur dioxide & color`, `alcohol & density`. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> These strongly correlated features imply that our feature selection will probably be able to use just one of these pairs to best describe quality in our model. When features are strongly correlated, the value of one of them will give information about the other feature. If they have an established relationship, the information provided by including both of them will be minimal so I suspect that feature selection will keep the feature from the pair that works better at discriminating quality."

    "# Question 3: OLS Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "For a parametric model, the key factor that will impact how easy it is to optimize is your choice of how to define the loss function. In Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression our loss function is just about as convenient as you will get: not only is it convex, its also very easy to interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "When doing supervised learning, a simple sanity check consists of comparing one’s estimator against simple rules of thumb. It is useful as a simple baseline to compare with other (real) regressors. Examples of regression baselines include:\n",
    "* \"mean\": always predicts the mean of the training set\n",
    "* \"median\": always predicts the median of the training set\n",
    "* \"quantile\": always predicts a specified quantile of the training set,provided with the quantile parameter.\n",
    "* \"constant\": always predicts a constant value that is provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question you'll \"choose\" a baseline model and then write a function to compute the loss of a linear model in Spark. You'll reuse this function in Q4 when you implement gradient descent.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> We interpret this graphically as the line that minimizes the errors to the data points (distances from the line to the points) such that the loss function is the lowest. The error can be interpreted graphically as drawing a vertical line from the data point to the line, and squaring this vertical line's distance. To compute the loss: for each prediction along the line, we compute the squared error inside the sum for the loss function above, sum up these losses, and take the average. The line that minimizes this loss function will balance out the vertical lines between the line and the data points, that capture the error of our estimates. It will look like the line that best fits this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Augmenting a data point means adding an extra row or column to the datapoint, as we do above by by setting $x_{m+1}=1$. We do this so that we can write our loss function more simply. Our prediction will be the dot product between two vectors now: our parameters $\\theta$ (including weights and bias) and our augmented datapoint $x$ (actual data points and 1 for the bias product). Computing a dot product in one place for the prediction is cleaner to interpret and efficient using numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Computing the loss is embarassingly parallel because it can be done row by row for each data point since we can compute and emit squared error, which can be distributed to workers in parallel. The final calculation of mean squared error can be done through an aggregation like reduce or `.mean()`. The parallel processes do not need to communicate to each other at all during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ When we set the baseline to have 0 weights for the features' coefficients and the mean of `quality` for the bias, we get our OLS loss to be the same as our variance from part a: `0.760086564865664`. The baseline line we produced is just always predicting the mean value of `quality` for every data point. The OLS Loss is the mean squared error of our predictions, and guessing the mean of our prediction variable each time will produce a loss equal to the variance of the prediction variable since we are dealing with an unbiased estimator. The variance just measures the dispersion of the values around the mean; the MSE indicates how different the values of the estimator and the actual values of the parameters are. The MSE is a comparison of the estimator and the true parameter, as it were. If our estimate is always the mean, then the MSE measures dispersion around the mean, just like variance does.\n",

    "# Question 6: Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In question 5 we mentioned that computing the loss after each iteration is not strictly a part of Gradient Descent, its just convenient for visualizing our progress. This \"third step\" however comes with a tradeoff: it requires an extra pass through the data. Normally this would cause us to cringe except for the fact that both the loss computation and the gradient computation are very easy to parallelize - lots of the work can be done in place no shuffle needed for the aggregation. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)), sometimes called rotation estimation, or out-of-sample testing, is a model validation technique for assessing how well the model will generalize to an independent data set. The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation, which will solve the problem of the unreliable test-loss that we saw in question 5, presents a bit more of a scalability challenge. To avoid over-dependence on a particulary good or bad test/train split we divide the data into `k` roughly equal size parts and train `k` models. The `k-th` model is trained on all the data _except_ the `k-th` split which is used as a test set for that model. Finally we compute the loss by averaging together the test/train loss for each model. In this question we've provided a code base to perform gradient descent and cross validation in parallel. You'll fill in some of the key details based on your understanding from questions 1-5.\n",

    "### Q6 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ A naive approach to training an OLS Regression model with cross validation might be to simply perform Gradient Descent on each of the 5 models in sequence. In this naive approach, how many total passes would be made over the data? [__`HINT:`__ _it will depend on factors that you should be able to name._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ Read through the provided helper function `kResiduals()` and note where it gets used in the subsequent function `CVLoss()`. For each record in the original dataset, how many tuples does `kResiduals()` emit? What are the keys of these newly emitted records? How will these keys help us compute cross validated loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Complete the missing Spark code in `CVLoss()` so that this function returns the test/train cross validated error for a given set of data splits and their corresponding models. [__`TIP:`__ _your goal is to start from `partialLossRDD` and compute the test & train loss for each model so that the provided code can take the final average_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code:__ Read through the provided functions `partialGradients()` and `CVUpdate()`. These should have a familiar feel. Fill in the missing line in `CVUpdate()` to update each model and add the (new) array of coefficients to the `new_models` list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Read `GradientDescent_withCV()` and then run the provided code to perform 50 iterations and plot the error curves. What can you conclude from this graph?"

    "# Question 7: Regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal, as always, is to build a linear model that will extend well to unseen data. Chosing the right combination of features to optimize generalizability can be extremely computationally costly given that there are \\\\(2^{p}\\\\) potential models that can be built from \\\\(p\\\\) features. Traditional methods like forward selection would involve iteratively testing these options to asses which combinations of features achieve a statistically significant prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are two popular alternatives to OLS, which enable us to train generalizable models without the trouble of forward selection and/or manual feature selection.  Both methods take advantage of the bias-variance tradeoff by _shrinking_ the model coefficients towards 0 which reduces the variance of our model with little increase in bias. In practice this 'shrinkage' is achieved by adding a penalty (a.k.a. 'regularization') term to the means squared error loss function. In this question you will implement Gradient Descent with ridge and lasso regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ When performing regularization _do not_ include the bias in your regularization term calcultion (Recall, that throughout this assignment we've included the bias at index 0 in the vector of weights that is your model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ The regularization term for ridge regression is the square of the \\\\(L2\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of squares of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). Write the formulas for both the loss function and the gradient for Ridge Regularization and explain what extra step this will add to our gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ The regularization term for lasso regression is the \\\\(L1\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). Write the formulas for both the loss function and the gradient for Lasso Regularization and explain how the gradient descent update in Lasso will be different than it was in Ridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Fill in the first two missing code blocks in `GDUpdate_wReg()` so that this function will perform a single parameter update using \\\\(L2\\\\) regularization if the parameter `regType` is set to `ridge`, \\\\(L1\\\\) regularization if set to `lasso` and unregularized OLS otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code + short response:__ Use the provided code to train 50 iterations of ridge and lasso regression and plot the test/train error. Comment on the curves you see. Does this match your expectation?"
